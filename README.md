## Overview

Searching Visualizer is a web application that provides a visual representation of how linear search and binary search algorithms work. It allows users to interactively understand the difference between these two search algorithms through animations and step-by-step demonstrations.

## Features

- **Visualize Linear Search**: See how linear search iterates through each element in the list to find a target element.

- **Visualize Binary Search**: Observe the binary search algorithm divide and conquer the sorted list to find the target element.

- **Step-by-Step Explanation**: Get a clear step-by-step explanation of each search algorithm's progress.

- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust the input list, target element, and animation speed for a tailored learning experience.

- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes and devices.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Live Demo**: Visit the [Searching Visualizer](https://6519691fac5f2a4e5deb45b7--idyllic-griffin-41f70e.netlify.app/) website.

2. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose between "Linear Search" or "Binary Search."

3. **Input Parameters**:
   - Enter a list of numbers.
   - Specify the target element you want to search for.

4. **Start Visualization**: Click the "Visualize" button to start the visualization.

5. **Observe and Learn**: Watch the animation and read the step-by-step explanation to understand how the selected search algorithm works.

6. **Customize and Repeat**: Experiment with different inputs, animation speeds, and algorithms to deepen your understanding.
